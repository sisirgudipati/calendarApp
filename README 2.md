Our calendar supports adding, deleting, and modifying events per users. It takes a double click on each button to access the button's function. In addition, users are able to create accounts and login, as well as logout after they are done viewing their calculator. If there are too many events on a certain day, we implemented a scrolling feature as well that allows the user to scroll through the events listed on that day. In addition, users will only be able to add, delete, and update events once they are logged in or registered. Otherwise, that division will stay hidden. In terms of web security, we implemented tokens and were able to validate/authenticate them. The calendar displays as a table grid with automatically generated dates in each grid entry. Additionally, the calendar will only display events for the month that it is currently "on" even if elements representing days from past or future months are present. All actions are performed without ever reloading the page. The website is safe from XSS attacks, SQL Injection attacks, CSRF tokens are passed into the website, passwords are stored salted and hashed, and the code is well-formatted and easy to read. The user can view infinitely many months into the future and past.
